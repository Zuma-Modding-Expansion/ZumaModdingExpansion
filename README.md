# Zuma Modding Expansion
Is a project that aims to increase the possibilities you have when modding the game by adding a whole new set of possibilities for the modmakers
New map customizations, New menu System and a lot more.

Everything will be detailed in a document we'll provide soon.



# Zuma Deluxe Decompilation

Based on reverse engineering of Mac and Windows executables distributed on PopCap.com.

Status: Fully playable, but potential bugs and inaccuracies are expected.

Dependencies:
- It's pretty much self contained, it compiles and works fine with MinGW and MSVC toolchains.
- CMake 3.18+: https://cmake.org/
- BASS 1.8 DLL, shipped with original game, if you're compiling a 32-bit version.
- or BASS 2.4 DLL, which you can get from https://www.un4seen.com/, required for 64-bit builds 
  (as BASS 1.x is not available for 64-bit platforms), optionally supported in 32-bit builds.

Differencies / accuracy notes:
- The most noticeable difference is that this project is based on open-source release of SexyAppFramework (1.3), with patches to bring back certain old behavior. Later we may reverse engineer framework code and bring it closer to older/internal versions of SexyApp.
- To reduce legal risk, we do not aim to reverse engineer DRM stuff, the resulting executable is DRM-free.
- Game logic code is where we put most care and aim for asm accuracy where possible.
- Certain variable/parameter names and missing methods have been reconstructed by reverse engineering Flash/C# ports of Zuma's Revenge and Zuma web game.

Legal notes:
- The source code of game itself (everything in `source/CircleShootApp/`) is provided as-is.
- Any modifications are licensed under MIT.
- The main focus of the project is bug-fixing, modding and porting and is done in a good faith - we don't condone 
  piracy, we just essentially want to give the game a "second life".
- The decompilation project does not include any assets - you need to get them from your own copy of the game - if 
  you don't own it, Steam version is easily available: https://store.steampowered.com/app/3330/Zuma_Deluxe/
